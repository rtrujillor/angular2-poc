# Angular 2 QuickStart Source

This repository holds the TypeScript source code of the Tutorial [Tutorial : Tour of heroes ](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/),
the foundation for most of the documentation samples and potentially a good starting point for your investigations with Angular 2.

It's been extended with testing support so you can start writing tests immediately, and has been reestructured to organize  the source files better.

## Create a new project based on the tutorial

Clone this repo into new project folder (e.g., `my-proj`).
```bash
git clone  https://github.com/rtrujillor/angular2-poc.git  my-proj
cd my-proj
```
## Install npm packages

Install the npm packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

**Attention Windows Developers:  You must run all of these commands in administrator mode**

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The `npm start` command first compiles the application, 
then simultaneously re-compiles and runs the `lite-server`.
Both the compiler and the server watch for file changes.

Shut it down manually with Ctrl-C.

You're ready to write your application.
## Working behind a proxy
Under the proxy-config-examples directory, you can have some examples of configuration files for npm, git and typings (typescript) for not having problems executing the npm scripts behind a proxy, I had them!

### npm scripts

We've captured many of the most useful commands in npm scripts defined in the `package.json`:

* `npm start` - runs the compiler and a server at the same time, both in "watch mode".
* `npm run tsc` - runs the TypeScript compiler once.
* `npm run tsc:w` - runs the TypeScript compiler in watch mode; the process keeps running, awaiting changes to TypeScript files and re-compiling when it sees them.
* `npm run lite` - runs the [lite-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lite-server), a light-weight, static file server, written and maintained by
[John Papa](https://github.com/johnpapa) and
[Christopher Martin](https://github.com/cgmartin)
with excellent support for Angular apps that use routing.
* `npm run typings` - runs the typings tool.
* `npm run postinstall` - called by *npm* automatically *after* it successfully completes package installation. This script installs the TypeScript definition files this app requires.

Here are the test related scripts:
* `npm test` - compiles, runs and watches the karma unit tests
* `npm run webdriver:update` - ONE TIME update for protractor end-to-end (e2e) tests
* `npm run e2e` - run protractor e2e tests, written in JavaScript (*e2e-spec.js)

## Testing

The Tutorial documentation doesn't discuss testing. 
This repo adds both karma/jasmine unit test and protractor end-to-end testing support.

These tools are configured for specific conventions described below.

*It is unwise and rarely possible to run the application, the unit tests, and the e2e tests at the same time.
We recommend that you shut down one before starting another.*

### Unit Tests
TypeScript unit-tests are usually under the `app` folder. Their filenames must end in `.spec`.

Look for the example `app/components/app/app.component.spec.ts`.
Add more `.spec.ts` files as you wish; we configured karma to find them.

Run it with `npm test`

That command first compiles the application, then simultaneously re-compiles and runs the karma test-runner.
Both the compiler and the karma watch for (different) file changes.

Shut it down manually with Ctrl-C.

Test-runner output appears in the terminal window.
We can update our app and our tests in real-time, keeping a weather eye on the console for broken tests.
Karma is occasionally confused and it is often necessary to shut down its browser or even shut the command down (Ctrl-C) and
restart it. No worries; it's pretty quick.

The `HTML-Reporter` is also wired in. That produces a prettier output; look for it in `~_test-output/tests.html`.
The `Coverage-Reporter` is also wired in. It produces its output in `~coverage/index.html`.

### End-to-end (E2E) Tests

**BEFORE RUNNING THE FIRST TEST** you must update the Selenium webdriver. Run `npm run webdriver:update`.

E2E tests are usually at the project root, above the `app` folder. 
Their filenames must end in `e2e-spec.js`.

E2E tests must be written in JavaScript.

Look for the example `e2e-spec.ts` in the root folder.
Add more `e2e-spec.js` files as you wish (although one usually suffices for small projects); 
we configured protractor to find them.


Thereafter, run them with `npm run e2e`.

That command first compiles, then simultaneously starts the Http-Server at `localhost:8080`
and launches protractor.  

The pass/fail test results appear at the bottom of the terminal window.
A custom reporter (see `protractor.config.js`) generates a  `./protractor-results.txt` file 
which is easier to read; this file is excluded from source control.

Shut it down manually with Ctrl-C.
